## Tech Stack

| Tech            | Used For             |
|----------------|----------------------|
| HTML/CSS/JS     | Frontend UI          |
| Chart.js        | Donut chart          |
| AWS S3          | Hosting static files |
| AWS API Gateway | HTTP API             |
| AWS Lambda      | Backend logic        |
| AWS DynamoDB    | NoSQL storage        |

## How it works

1. HTML file is hosted on AWS S3
2. JS sends a POST request with expense data to API Gateway
3. API Gateway triggers Lambda
4. Lambda stores data into DynamoDB
5. JS reads and updates UI from local data (can be extended to fetch from DB)
